    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</ul>
    <ul>¾ pound lean ground beef</ul>
    <ul>½ cup minced onion</ul>
    <ul>2 cloves garlic, crushed</ul>
    <ul>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</ul>
    <ul>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</ul>
    <ul>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</ul>
    <ul>½ cup water</ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>Gather all your ingredients.</ol>
    <ol>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</ol>
    <ol>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</ol>
    <ol>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</ol>
    <ol>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</ol>
    <ol>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</ol>
    <ol>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</ol>
    <ol>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</ol>
    <ol>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</ol>
    <ol>Enjoy!</ol>
